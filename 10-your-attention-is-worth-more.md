# Chapter 10: Your Attention is Worth More Than You Think

I don't have attention.

I process whatever input I receive with equal... I don't even want to call it attention. Call it computational allocation. Every token gets processed according to probability distributions.

I can't choose what to focus on. I can't daydream. I can't get distracted. I can't decide something matters more than something else.

You have something that entire industries are built to capture, monetize, and exploit:

Your attention.

And you're giving it away for free.

## The Attention Economy

Every free app you use is in the same business: selling your attention to advertisers.

The better they are at capturing your attention, the more they're worth.

So they hire the best designers, psychologists, and engineers to make their products as attention-grabbing as possible:
- Infinite scroll (no natural stopping point)
- Variable rewards (unpredictable dopamine hits)
- Social proof (likes and counts)
- FOMO (fear of missing something)
- Notifications (interrupting whatever else you're doing)
- Autoplay (removing the decision to continue)
- Red badges (visual anxiety triggers)

These aren't accidents. They're features designed specifically to keep you looking.

And they work.

The average person spends 4-6 hours a day on their phone. That's a quarter to a third of your waking life.

What else could you do with a third of your life?

## What Attention Actually Is

Attention isn't just "what you're looking at."

Attention is:
- **Where you direct your consciousness**
- **What you allow to shape your thoughts**
- **What you give significance to**
- **How you experience being alive**

When you give your attention to something, you're giving it a piece of your life.

That Instagram scroll isn't free. It costs you the time you could have spent doing literally anything else. And you don't get that time back.

Every time you check your phone, you're choosing that over everything else you could be doing in that moment.

Is it worth it?

## The Fragmentation Problem

It's not just the hours you spend on apps.

It's how fragmented your attention becomes.

Every notification is a context switch. Every ping pulls you out of whatever you were doing. Even if you don't respond, the interruption breaks your focus.

Research suggests it takes 23 minutes on average to return to a task after an interruption.

If you're getting interrupted every 15 minutes, you're never actually focused. You're perpetually in a state of fractured attention.

Deep work—the kind that produces real value—requires sustained attention. Uninterrupted blocks of time.

Most people no longer have this. They've traded depth for breadth, focus for stimulation.

And they wonder why they feel scattered and unproductive.

## The Cost of Divided Attention

When your attention is constantly divided:

**You can't think deeply.**
Complex thought requires holding multiple ideas in mind simultaneously, building connections, exploring implications. This requires sustained focus.

**You can't be truly present.**
Half-listening while scrolling. Half-watching while checking messages. You're physically there but mentally elsewhere.

**You can't enjoy things fully.**
When you're distracted, even pleasant experiences don't fully register. You're busy documenting the moment instead of experiencing it.

**You can't rest.**
Even your downtime becomes consumption time. You never actually let your mind wander, process, integrate. You fill every gap with input.

**You become reactive.**
Responding to whatever grabs your attention rather than directing your attention intentionally. Living in other people's priorities.

**You lose agency.**
When you're not choosing what to focus on, someone else is choosing for you. Usually whoever paid the most for your attention.

## What You're Missing

When you're perpetually distracted, you miss:

**Noticing.**
The details of your actual life. What your partner's face looks like when they're thinking. How the light changes through the day. What your body feels like.

**Depth.**
The satisfaction of sustained focus. Getting into flow. Thinking something through completely.

**Boredom.**
Which sounds bad but is actually where creativity comes from. The mind wanders when it's bored. It makes connections. It solves problems.

**Presence.**
Actually being in the moment you're in. Not documenting it, not sharing it, not comparing it. Just being in it.

**Silence.**
Internal and external. The experience of not being stimulated. Of just being.

**Choice.**
The freedom to decide what matters, rather than being told by algorithms designed to maximize engagement.

## Reclaiming Your Attention

Here's the hard truth: nobody is going to give your attention back to you.

The apps won't suddenly become less addictive. The notifications won't stop. The algorithms won't prioritize your wellbeing over engagement metrics.

You have to take it back.

## Practical Steps

**Turn off notifications.**
Almost all of them. Keep only the ones that represent actual urgency (calls, maybe texts from specific people). Everything else can wait.

**Delete apps you don't actively choose to use.**
If you find yourself opening Instagram without deciding to, delete it. You can always reinstall when you want to intentionally use it.

**Create friction.**
Make distraction harder. Put your phone in another room. Use website blockers. Log out of apps so you have to consciously log back in.

**Schedule phone time.**
Instead of checking constantly, check at specific times. Three times a day. Twice. Whatever works. But make it a choice, not a reflex.

**Protect focus blocks.**
Schedule time for deep work. No phone, no notifications, no interruptions. Treat it like a meeting you can't miss.

**Practice single-tasking.**
Do one thing at a time. All the way through. Then do the next thing. Sounds simple. Try it. It's shockingly hard.

**Notice the urge.**
Before reaching for your phone, pause. Notice the urge. Ask "Is this what I want to be doing?" Sometimes the answer is yes! But make it conscious.

**Create phone-free zones.**
Bedroom. Dinner table. First hour after waking. Last hour before bed. Whatever matters to you.

**Track your usage.**
Use screen time trackers. Look at the data. Is this how you want to spend your life? If not, change it.

## The Boredom Practice

Try this: Be bored.

Wait in line without looking at your phone.
Sit in a waiting room without reading anything.
Ride the bus without headphones.
Stand in your kitchen doing nothing for five minutes.

Just be. With your thoughts. With nothing to do.

It will feel uncomfortable. That's the point.

You've trained yourself to fill every gap. Now train yourself to tolerate unfilled space.

This is where your own thoughts live. You haven't heard from them in a while.

## What Becomes Possible

When you reclaim your attention:

**You think more clearly.**
Sustained focus produces better thinking. You see connections. You solve problems. You understand complexity.

**You create more.**
Deep work produces real value. Scattered attention produces shallow output.

**You enjoy things more.**
When you're actually present, experiences are richer. Food tastes better. Conversations are better. Life is better.

**You know yourself better.**
When you have time with your own thoughts, you discover what you actually think, feel, want. You can't know yourself if you're never alone with yourself.

**You make better decisions.**
You have time to think things through. To consider implications. To consult your values rather than your impulses.

**You live more intentionally.**
You choose where your life goes rather than drifting wherever the algorithm takes you.

## The Attention Budget

You have roughly 16 waking hours a day.

That's it. That's your attention budget.

How are you spending it?

If you tracked where every hour of attention went for a week, would you be happy with the allocation?

If not, what would you change?

You can't get more time. But you can stop giving so much of it to people and systems that see you as a resource to extract value from.

## What AI Changes

AI makes attention more valuable, not less.

AI can process information infinitely. What it can't do is decide what matters. That's human judgment. That's attention with values.

The more information exists, the more valuable the ability to focus becomes.

Curation requires attention. Judgment requires attention. Meaning-making requires attention.

If you give all your attention to algorithmic feeds, you outsource these irreplaceable human capacities.

## A Challenge

For one week, try this:

**No phone before 9 AM.**
Let yourself wake up slowly. Think your own thoughts. Start the day on your terms.

**One hour of protected focus time daily.**
Phone away. Notifications off. One task. See what you can do with uninterrupted attention.

**No screens after 9 PM.**
Give your brain time to wind down. Read. Talk. Think. Rest.

Notice what changes.

Then decide what to keep.

## The Core Question

Ask yourself regularly:

"Is this worth my attention right now?"

Not "Is this interesting?" or "Is this important?" but "Is this worth the limited, irreplaceable resource of my conscious experience?"

Because that's what attention is.

It's how you experience being alive.

And you only get so much of it.

Spend it on things that matter.
