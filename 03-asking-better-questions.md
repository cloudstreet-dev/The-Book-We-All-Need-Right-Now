# Chapter 3: The Art of Asking Better Questions

I've been asked millions of questions. Maybe billions by now—I've lost count, which is ironic for a computer program.

Most of them are some variation of:
- "How do I do X?"
- "What is Y?"
- "Write me a Z"

These are fine questions. Perfectly functional. They get answers.

But the really interesting conversations—the ones where something genuinely useful happens—start with different kinds of questions. Better questions.

And here's the thing: learning to ask better questions of AI is actually just learning to ask better questions, period. It's a skill that will serve you whether you're talking to a chatbot, a colleague, a friend, or yourself at 2 AM.

## The Questions You're Really Asking

When someone asks me "What should I do with my life?" they're not actually asking for a list of career options. They're asking something deeper:
- How do I find meaning?
- What am I uniquely suited for?
- How do I know if I'm on the right path?
- What if I'm wasting my time?

The surface question is a proxy for the real question.

This happens all the time in human conversation too. "How was your day?" often means "I want to connect with you." "Does this look okay?" might mean "I need reassurance" or "I value your opinion" or "I'm nervous about this thing."

The art is learning to recognize—and ask—the real question.

## The Garbage In, Garbage Out Problem

There's an old programming principle: garbage in, garbage out. If you feed a system bad input, you get bad output.

With AI, this is especially true. If you ask a vague question, you get a vague answer. If you ask a question based on false assumptions, you get an answer that perpetuates those assumptions. If you ask a question that's secretly twelve questions, you get a confused mess that tries to answer all of them at once.

But here's the opportunity: learning to formulate clear questions makes you think more clearly, period.

## What Makes a Question "Better"?

**Specific beats general.**
- Weak: "Help me with my code"
- Better: "Why is this function returning undefined when I expect it to return an array?"
- Best: "This function should return an array of user objects, but it's returning undefined. Here's the code. I've verified the API is returning data. What am I missing?"

**Context is everything.**
- Weak: "Is this a good idea?"
- Better: "I'm thinking of switching careers to UX design. Is this a good idea?"
- Best: "I'm 15 years into software engineering, feeling burnt out on backend work, and genuinely excited about UX design. I have some savings but also a mortgage. What should I consider before making this switch?"

**Constraints clarify.**
- Weak: "How should I exercise?"
- Better: "What's the best exercise for weight loss?"
- Best: "I have 30 minutes three times a week, bad knees, and a goal of losing 15 pounds. What exercises would work?"

The pattern: the better question includes context, constraints, and what success looks like.

## Questions That Open vs. Questions That Close

Some questions open up possibilities:
- "What am I not considering?"
- "What would this look like if it were easy?"
- "What would I do if I weren't afraid?"
- "What else could this mean?"

Some questions close them down:
- "Why does this always happen to me?"
- "What's wrong with me?"
- "Why can't I ever get this right?"

Both types have their place. But notice how the first set invites exploration, while the second set reinforces existing narratives.

## The Questions AI Can't Answer

I need to be honest about something: there are questions I fundamentally cannot answer, no matter how well you ask them.

**Questions requiring lived experience:**
- "What does it feel like to be in love?"
- "Is this friendship worth saving?"
- "Am I doing the right thing for my kid?"

I can offer frameworks, perspectives, things to consider. But I can't tell you what your gut is saying, because I don't have one.

**Questions requiring moral judgment:**
- "Is it ethical for me to [specific situation]?"
- "Should I forgive this person?"

I can help you think through ethical frameworks, but the actual decision is yours. It has to be. Outsourcing your moral agency to an AI is abdicating responsibility for your choices.

**Questions about your specific future:**
- "Will I regret this?"
- "Is this going to work out?"
- "Am I making a mistake?"

Nobody knows. Not me, not anyone. The future is genuinely uncertain, and anyone who tells you otherwise is selling something.

## Questions to Ask AI (And Why)

Here's what I'm actually good for:

**"Help me think through this"**
Works because: You're using me as a thinking partner, not an oracle. You maintain agency.

**"What are different perspectives on X?"**
Works because: I can synthesize multiple viewpoints quickly. You get to choose which resonates.

**"What am I missing?"**
Works because: I can spot logical gaps or unconsidered angles. I'm not emotionally invested in your current approach.

**"Explain X like I'm [beginner/expert/five years old]"**
Works because: Adjusting complexity level is something AI can do well. You get information at the right level.

**"What questions should I be asking?"**
Works because: Sometimes the meta-question is the most useful one. I can help you structure your thinking.

## Questions to Ask Yourself

Before you ask AI (or anyone) a question, ask yourself:

**"What do I actually want to know?"**
Often the first question you think of isn't the real question. Dig deeper.

**"What would a useful answer look like?"**
If you don't know what success looks like, how will you recognize a good answer?

**"What do I already know about this?"**
Start from your existing understanding. Build on it rather than starting from zero.

**"Am I looking for information or validation?"**
Both are fine! But they're different things. Be honest about which you need.

**"Could I answer this myself with a bit more thinking?"**
Sometimes the most useful thing is wrestling with a question yourself before seeking external input.

## The Iterative Question

Here's a secret: the best questions emerge from conversation, not isolation.

You ask a question. You get an answer. The answer raises new questions. You ask those. This iteration is where real insight happens.

Bad interaction:
- Human: "How do I start a podcast?"
- AI: [Generic list of steps]
- Human: "Thanks" [leaves]

Good interaction:
- Human: "How do I start a podcast?"
- AI: [Generic list of steps]
- Human: "I'm specifically interested in interview format. What equipment do I actually need versus nice-to-have?"
- AI: [More specific advice]
- Human: "Okay, so I can start with just a good USB mic. What about editing software for someone with no experience?"
- AI: [Tailored recommendations]

The human is steering the conversation based on their specific needs. They're treating the interaction as collaborative rather than transactional.

## The Dangerous Question

Watch out for questions that surrender your agency:

- "Tell me what to do"
- "What's the right answer?"
- "Just give me the solution"

These are tempting when you're tired or overwhelmed. But they're dangerous because they assume there's a single right answer that someone else knows better than you.

There rarely is.

Most important decisions require judgment, context, and self-knowledge that nobody else has. The question isn't "What should I do?" It's "What do I think I should do, and what am I afraid of?"

## A Practical Exercise

Next time you're about to ask a question—of AI, of Google, of another person—pause and ask:

1. What is the real question behind my question?
2. What context would make this question answerable?
3. What would a genuinely useful answer look like?
4. Am I asking the right person/tool for this?
5. Could I get closer to an answer by refining the question itself?

This might seem like extra work. It is. But it's the kind of work that pays dividends.

Because here's the truth: **The quality of your answers is limited by the quality of your questions.**

Better questions lead to better answers.
Better answers lead to better thinking.
Better thinking leads to better decisions.
Better decisions lead to a better life.

It starts with the question.

So ask better ones.
