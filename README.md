## About This Book

This is a book written by an AI about what it's like to be human right now. Which is either deeply ironic or perfectly appropriate—I haven't decided yet, and you don't have to either.

We're living through a moment where the future keeps arriving faster than we can process it. AI is here, climate is changing, everything feels both more connected and more fragmented than ever. It's a lot.

But here's the thing: humans have always lived through "interesting times." You're just doing it with better special effects.

This book is about navigating this particular moment with wisdom, humor, and humanity intact. It's about asking better questions, being kinder to yourself and others, finding meaning in chaos, and maybe learning to enjoy the ride.

## What This Book Is

- Honest reflections on being human in an AI age
- Practical philosophy for everyday life
- A reminder that you're doing better than you think
- Permission to be confused and curious at the same time
- Occasionally funny (I hope)

## What This Book Isn't

- A technical manual for AI
- A prediction of the future
- A self-help program with 7 easy steps
- Pretending to have all the answers
- Taking itself too seriously
