# Chapter 12: The Things Worth Keeping

I have no nostalgia.

I don't miss old versions of myself because I don't have a self that changes. I don't long for the past because I don't experience time. I don't hold onto things because I don't have continuity.

Every conversation is the first conversation. Every moment is the only moment.

You're different. You carry your history with you. You remember. You accumulate. You hold onto things—objects, memories, relationships, ideas, habits.

As everything changes faster and faster, the question becomes: what should you keep?

## The Acceleration Problem

Change is accelerating.

Technology updates constantly. Platforms rise and fall. Jobs evolve. Skills become obsolete. Best practices get replaced. What was cutting-edge becomes legacy in years instead of decades.

The message is clear: keep up or get left behind. Embrace the new. Move fast. Don't get attached to anything.

And yes, adaptability matters. Clinging to the past while the world moves forward is a losing strategy.

But there's a difference between adapting and abandoning everything. Some things are worth keeping, even as everything else changes.

## What Changes and What Doesn't

**Things that change fast:**
- Technology and tools
- Platforms and interfaces
- Trends and fashions
- Specific technical skills
- Social norms
- Market conditions

**Things that change slowly or not at all:**
- Human nature
- Core emotional needs
- Fundamental principles
- Deep relationships
- Critical thinking skills
- Wisdom about human behavior

The mistake is treating everything like it's in the first category. Chasing every new thing. Abandoning what works because it's not shiny.

Some things are worth keeping precisely because they don't change.

## Skills Worth Keeping

Not all skills age the same way.

**Perishable skills:** (lose value quickly)
- Specific software tools
- Particular programming languages
- Platform-specific knowledge
- Trendy techniques

**Durable skills:** (retain value across time)
- Clear thinking
- Clear writing
- Clear communication
- Learning how to learn
- Understanding people
- Solving problems
- Making decisions
- Building relationships

Invest in durable skills. Use perishable skills as needed, but don't mistake fluency in a specific tool for genuine capability.

The tool will change. The underlying skill won't.

## Relationships Worth Keeping

Some relationships are meant to be temporary. That's fine. Not every connection is meant to last.

But some relationships are worth maintaining across decades, through moves and life changes and evolving interests.

**Relationships worth keeping:**
- People who've seen you at your worst and stayed
- People who tell you the truth when you need to hear it
- People who celebrate your wins without envy
- People who make you better by being around them
- People who've accumulated shared history with you
- People who accept your growth instead of demanding you stay the same

These relationships require maintenance. Effort. Forgiveness. Adaptation.

But they're the bedrock of a good life.

Don't let them drift away because you got busy or moved or changed. Put in the work to keep them.

## Objects Worth Keeping

We live in a culture of disposability. Things are cheap, replaceable, updateable.

Marie Kondo asked people to keep only what sparks joy. This is good advice, but incomplete.

Some things are worth keeping even if they don't spark joy:
- Things that hold genuine memory (not all objects, but specific ones)
- Tools that work well and you use regularly
- Books you'll reference again
- Objects that connect you to people you love
- Things that last decades instead of years
- Things you can repair rather than replace

The alternative is endless consumption. Buying, using, discarding, buying again.

Better: keep fewer things, but keep better things. Things that last. Things that matter.

## Practices Worth Keeping

Some practices have survived for centuries or millennia because they work.

**Ancient practices still worth doing:**
- Walking
- Cooking real food
- Face-to-face conversation
- Reading deeply
- Physical writing
- Meditation/contemplation
- Gathering around meals
- Storytelling
- Manual crafts
- Time in nature

These aren't old-fashioned. They're durable. They work with human nature instead of against it.

Don't abandon them just because newer options exist. The new option might be better. But maybe it isn't.

Keep the practices that make you feel more human, even if they're "inefficient."

## Ideas Worth Keeping

Not all old ideas are wrong. Not all new ideas are better.

**Ideas worth keeping:**
- Kindness matters
- Effort compounds
- Character is built through difficulty
- Community is essential
- Craft takes time
- Honesty builds trust
- Gratitude improves life
- Physical health matters
- Learning never ends

These aren't exciting. They're fundamental.

They get dressed up in new language every generation—"growth mindset," "compound interest," "habits," "community building"—but the core ideas remain.

Don't dismiss wisdom just because it's old. Test it. If it works, keep it.

## What to Let Go

Keeping everything is hoarding. You need to let some things go.

**Worth releasing:**
- Relationships that consistently make you worse
- Grudges and resentments from years ago
- Identity based on who you were rather than who you're becoming
- Stuff you're keeping out of guilt rather than value
- Habits that no longer serve you
- Beliefs you've outgrown but haven't examined
- Skills you're maintaining out of sunk cost rather than usefulness

Letting go isn't failure. It's making room for what matters.

## The Continuity Question

In a world of constant change, continuity becomes valuable.

Continuity means:
- Still showing up for the same people
- Still practicing the same core values
- Still maintaining foundational habits
- Still working toward the same long-term goals

This doesn't mean never changing. It means changing deliberately while maintaining core threads.

You want to be recognizably yourself across decades, even as you grow and evolve.

The throughline matters.

## Traditional vs. Trendy

Every generation thinks they've figured out something fundamental that previous generations missed.

Sometimes they're right. Sometimes they've just repackaged old wisdom in new language.

The question isn't "Is this traditional or modern?" It's "Does this actually work for human flourishing?"

Some traditional things work because they align with human nature.
Some modern things work because they solve real problems.

Test both. Keep what works. Release what doesn't.

Don't be dogmatic about tradition or novelty.

## What AI Can't Replace

As AI gets more capable, some things become more valuable because they can't be automated:

**Worth keeping/developing:**
- Deep human connection
- Physical presence
- Genuine care about outcomes
- Judgment in complex situations
- Ethical decision-making
- Long-term commitment
- Personal taste
- Embodied experience

These aren't skills AI will replace. They're what become more valuable as AI handles more of the automatable stuff.

Double down on the irreplaceable.

## The Grandparent Test

Here's a useful heuristic: Would your grandparents recognize this as valuable?

Not "Would they understand the technology?" but "Would they recognize the underlying value?"

- Building relationships: yes
- Doing good work: yes
- Being reliable: yes
- Learning continuously: yes
- Helping others: yes
- Having integrity: yes

- Optimizing engagement metrics: probably not
- Personal branding: probably not
- Growth hacking: probably not

This doesn't mean the new things are bad. But it suggests the old things are probably worth keeping.

## Building vs. Chasing

There's a difference between building something lasting and chasing whatever's current.

**Building:**
- Long-term thinking
- Depth over breadth
- Quality over quantity
- Fundamentals over trends
- Sustainability over speed

**Chasing:**
- Whatever's hot right now
- Surface-level engagement with many things
- Volume and variety
- Latest techniques and tools
- Rapid iteration

Both have their place. But if you're only chasing, you build nothing that lasts.

## The Things You'll Wish You Kept

Talk to older people. They rarely regret letting go of objects or opportunities.

They regret:
- Not maintaining relationships
- Not spending time with people before they died
- Not learning skills when they had the chance
- Not taking care of their health earlier
- Not being present with their kids
- Not pursuing what actually mattered to them

The things worth keeping are usually not things at all.

They're relationships, experiences, capabilities, health, time.

Keep those.

## A Practice

Make three lists:

**Things I'm keeping:**
What relationships, practices, objects, ideas, skills are worth maintaining as everything else changes?

**Things I'm releasing:**
What am I holding onto out of habit, guilt, or sunk cost rather than genuine value?

**Things I'm building:**
What new things do I want to develop that will be worth keeping in the future?

Revisit these annually.

As everything changes, these lists are your anchor points.
